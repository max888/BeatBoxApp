## First Project for WDI December-March intake.


I created this app using RoR for my first project at General Assembly's WDI. It is a music application where users can login, upload their tracks and view other profiles while listening to other users music.

It uses:

* Devise
* Ransack
* Carrierwave
* CanCan
